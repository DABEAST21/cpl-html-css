        <h1>Things wrong in the world</h1>
        <p>:People shoudn't treat women different because they look different or they do different things and mainly if your a man you might be stronger than the woman you think that you can beat them or take control of them well you can't. Some women take this as nothing and they don't do anything about it you shold do some thing about it. It does matter women matter to not just men matter everyone has a voice inside of them. </p>
         
         <p>If a man is harassing you and you are a women you need to take charge and tell them to stop. If they don't and you able to you need to call <a href="http://www.equalitynow.org/"> 911 immediatly. </a> Another thing that's wrong in the world is this. (Look below.) This man thinks he can run the world with his tiny tiny tiny mind and his stupid horible ideas. He is also married to a women about 24 years younger.
